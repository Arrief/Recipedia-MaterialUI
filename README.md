## About

This project is a UI showcase with otherwise limited functionality. I created it as a presentation during bootcamp to demonstrate the power of the React component library **MaterialUI/MUI**. Apart from a color variable, the font-family and resetting margin, nothing is styled with vanilla CSS.

The look of the webpage is achieved with MaterialUI's **highly customizable UI components**, which provide out-of-the-box solutions for styling and layout, like pre-defined breakpoints for responsive behavior, as well as an easy, effective way to modify each and every component to create unique and individual designs. Additionally, MUI components also come with **built-in functionality for user interaction**, simplifying the process of changing the UI based on React state changes and reducing the amount of JavaScript code the developer has to write.

The Profile page solely exists as a bonus showcase for another styling tool, the CSS-in-JS styling framework **styled-components**. The code for the profile page shows how easily and quickly you can set up styling rules within the JavaScript file and how effective styled-components can be when utilizing its feature to react to props added to its components: defining a default style for a component with the option to replace it on a case by case basis, based on individual modifiers.
